# Legal-Delivery-in-Cricket
It was a huge problem in cricket history that whenever a bowler balls a ball sometimes it results in an illegal or a false delivery due to their arm 
and umpires finds it bit diificult to recognize whether the delivery is illegal or not. So, here comes my solution:
I have used only one programming language and three different libraries mentioned below:
Source code language : Python3
Used libraries: OpenCV
                Mediapipe
                Numpy
Using OpenCV the source video will be read by the computer 
Using Mediapipe I have coded in a way that it will trace the locations of all the points where the movement is shown and then the all points are joined together to make an 
overlapping structure in green color
also I have used numpy arrays in calculations.
And lastly, I have created my own algorithm which is going to calculate the angle between arm and shoulder.
and i have added the status bar which will return the final output as illegal or legal delivery.
I hope you'll like my project.
Thank you
