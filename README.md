# Legal-Delivery-in-Cricket
It has long been an issue in cricket because when a bowler delivers a ball, their arm occasionally causes an unlawful or false delivery, making it difficult for umpires to determine if the delivery is legal or not. So, here's what I came up with: I only used one programming language and three libraries, which are listed below: Python3 is the source code language. OpenCV was used as a library. Numpy Mediapipe The computer will read the source video using OpenCV. I coded Mediapipe in such a manner that it will track the positions of all the places where the movement is visible, and then all of the points will be linked together to form an overlapping green structure.
also 
Numpy arrays have been utilised in my computations.
Finally, I developed my own algorithm for calculating the angle between the arm and the shoulder.
I've also included a status indicator that will indicate if the final output is unlawful or legal.
I'm hoping you'll enjoy my work.
Thank you very much.
