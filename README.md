# Legal-Delivery-in-Cricket
It has long been a problem in cricket since a bowler's arm can occasionally create an unlawful or fraudulent delivery, making it difficult for umpires to decide whether the delivery is legal or not. As a result, here's what I've come up with: There was just one programming language and three libraries that I utilised, which are mentioned below: The source code language is Python3. As a library, OpenCV was utilised. Mediapipe Numpy Using OpenCV, the computer will read the source video. I coded Mediapipe in such a way that it would track the locations of all the spots where movement is evident, and then connect all of the points to make an overlapping green structure.
Also numpy arrays have been utilised in my computations.
Finally, I developed my own algorithm for calculating the angle between the arm and the shoulder.
I've also included a status indicator that will indicate if the final output is unlawful or legal.
I'm hoping you'll enjoy my work.
Thank you very much.
